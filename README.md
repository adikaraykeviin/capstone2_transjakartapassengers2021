Transjakarta is designed as mass transportation system to support people activity in Jakarta that knowned for its congested traffic. Transjakata has 243 bus stops in 13 main route corridors operating 24 hours everyday in every corridors


## **Datasets**

There are 6 column in Transjakarta passengers dataset:

* tahun: year of the data is collected.
* bulan: month of the data is collected.
* jenis: type of vehicle.
* kode_trayek: route code.
* trayek: route.
* jumlah_penumpang: the number of passengers.

## **Problem Statement**

Jakarta has a population more than 10 million people as of mid 2021. the Transjakarta mission to reduce the traffic congestion in jakarta seems to not been fully accomplished yet. the company wants to now how to make Transjakarta even more profitable to improving Transjakarta facility getting more better.

As a Data Analyst, i will try to answer the question:

How to increase the profit, so the company can increase Transjakarta facility to make more people use transjakarta and reduce the traffic congestion in Jakarta..

## **Data Preparation and Cleaning**

* Remove Duplicate Values
* Handle Missing Values
* Create New Column
* Remove irrelevant Column

## **Conclusion**

From the analysis, we can conclude:

* Transjakarta passenger can reach 4 million people every month, which has 200.000 passenger every day (20 Work days)
* Total Passenger for whole year, BRT has 59,111,356 passenger, Mikrotrans has 49,915,801 passenger, Integrated Transport has 11.281.390 passenger.
* Total income for whole year, BRT has 177 billion rupiah, Mikrotrans has 0 rupiah, Integrated transport has 107 billion rupiah.
* Busiest Route is BRT came from Central Jakarta

## **Recommendation**

According to data and analysis:

* i recommend to increase revenue to improve Transjakarta facility, by charging Mikrotrans passenger into Rp1000 or even Rp2000. another option is to increase BRT ticket price into Rp5000 flat, because both transportation has many passangger by only 10 million people margin.

* by increasing the price tag, we can add more fleet and renovating bus stops. with more fleet, congestivity rate will reduced and passanger can get more comfortable using transjakarta.

* allocating some of the fleet with low volume into more higher volume are also needed.

* By increasing the price tag, we can hope that more middle upper class people will use Transjakarta because of its comfortability and affordability. If this plans works, it will reduce traffic and air Pollution in Jakarta.
